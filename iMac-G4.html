        Replacing the iMac, the all new personal computer iMac G4 was the first Mac to have a LCD display instead of its previous CRT display. The hard drive and <br> motherboard were 
        housed in a dome. Apple had advertised it to have an adjustable desk lamp and was sold in white. It came out with three models with prices ranging <br> between $1,299-$1,799, 
        which would range $2,200-$3,000 today.
