            <div class="col">
                <p>In a bold move that marked a significant evolution in Apple's product line, the iMac G4 succeeded its predecessor, introducing groundbreaking changes that set a new standard for 
                personal computing. Departing from the conventional cathode-ray tube (CRT) display, the iMac G4 proudly bore the distinction of being the first Mac to feature a liquid crystal 
                display (LCD). This transition not only enhanced visual clarity but also signaled Apple's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology.</p>
                
                <p>The iMac G4's design was nothing short of iconic. Departing from the traditional rectangular form, the computer's hard drive and motherboard found a home in a visually striking 
                dome-shaped base. Adding to its unique aesthetic, Apple marketed the iMac G4 as having an adjustable desk lamp, underlining its innovative approach to both form and function. The
                computer itself was presented in a clean and timeless white finish, aligning with Apple's design ethos of simplicity and elegance.</p> 
                
                <p>Upon its release, the iMac G4 was made available in three distinct models, catering to varying user needs. The price range for these models spanned from $1,299 to $1,799 in the 
                early 2000s, a cost that would equate to approximately $2,200 to $3,000 when adjusted for inflation. This pricing strategy aimed to make the iMac G4 accessible to a broad audience
                while positioning it as a premium computing solution.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the iMac G4 represented a milestone in Apple's pursuit of innovation. Its departure from the traditional desktop design showcased the company's 
                willingness to challenge conventions and reimagine the user experience. The iMac G4's legacy extends beyond its time, influencing subsequent designs and cementing Apple's 
                reputation as a trailblazer in the tech industry.</p> 
                
                <p>In retrospect, the iMac G4 stands as a testament to Apple's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology, offering not only a powerful computing solution but also a visually
                captivating and functionally innovative device that left an enduring mark on the evolution of personal computing.</p>
